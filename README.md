# CNN-ResNet_Human_sign_language
Image classification using CNN (ResNet50) for speech/hearing-impaired

## Tools Used:
Python, Numpy, TensorFlow (Backend), Keras, matplotlib


## Residual Networks
In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by He et al., allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

## Goals:

Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
